# medHealthProject
a dedicated Mental Health Consultation Web App. This initiative is born from a deep understanding of the unique challenges faced by university students, who often struggle to access timely and appropriate mental health care

At the heart of our proposal is developing an intuitive, accessible web app explicitly designed
for the university student body. The app will feature several key components aimed at
simplifying the process of obtaining mental health support: 
• Patient Profile Management: A secure space for students to manage their personal
and health-related information, ensuring a personalized and confidential service. 
• Appointment Scheduling System: An easy-to-navigate interface allowing students
to book, modify, or cancel appointments with mental health professionals based on
real-time availability. 
• Comprehensive Doctor Directory: Detailed profiles of available mental health
practitioners, including their specialities, qualifications, and schedules, to help
students make informed choices about their care. 
• Automated Email Notifications: A system for sending automatic confirmations,
reminders, and appointment updates, enhancing communication between students
and health professionals.
